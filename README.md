This is an effective script to Brute Force, the Private Key of any Bitcoin Public Address.


Remember, `it is just a demo code, you should download it and run on your pc`, here it is just for testing ONLY !!!

if you want more :

 
~BTC Address:   **1FeexVJtCiVkEKGJiMEgzPh3z9LSUC8t5z** ~




i think is quite simple.

How does the script work? 
Very easy.

Every code IÂ´ve seen for the last year just generates randomly private and public addresses and checks the balance (very, very slow for the API Request).

So, i found **100,000+ Bitcoin Addresses** with 1+ BTC from 2009+ NEVER made a transaction, therefore, lost BTC... it is just like huge pirate boats in the bottom of the ocean filled with treasures.

In the file input.txt are the Addreses for crack the keys.

Any results will be saved in Treasures.txt file.

This Script creates randomly private and public addresses without checking the balance, instead of making API Request, the created Public Address is compared with the list I own.

Long story short. 
Create Random Public Address (**RPA**) and check one by one with the Public Address (**PA**) at the list.

**if RPC == PA then
	YOU WINNED THE LOTTREY!
else
	KEEP SEARCHING MTF!**
	
(Script tested on i7-4500U 8 Cores - 5 K/s per Core. 3,456,000 Private Keys generated per day)

i think is quite simple.
